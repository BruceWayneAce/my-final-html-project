<h1>This page is about me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Frank Tonye,i'm from Port Harcourt Rivers State. I come from a family of 7 of which i'm  <br> the 4th child of my amazing parents. <br>
    Growing up in the heart of PH was a really interesting part of my growth, <br> both mentally and psychologically as it has helped mould me 
    into this fine smart gentle man as my best friend would call me. <br>
    I picked a lot of interests of what i would love to grow up and becoming as a child,a lot of interests that never came to fruition. <br>
    From the excitments of the chuff sounds from a whirling helicopter rotor that made me feel i was destined to be a pilot. <br>
    Anyway i'm en route to being a very well decorated programmer,and i feel optimistic about this one. <br><br>
